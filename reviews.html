<p> 
    This handsome man is called<strong>Immanuel Kant</strong>
</p>

<p>
    Kant tried to completely rethink the way we look at our environment and our role in it.
    His large ideas need a lot of space, hence the enormous forehead. 
    Kant in general is considered a genius, but this is solemnly due to noone understanding him.
    A good example would be his theory about<strong>enlightenment:</strong> 
</p>

<p>    "Aufklärung ist der Ausgang des Menschen aus seiner selbst verschuldeten Unmündigkeit. 
    Unmündigkeit ist das Unvermögen, sich seines Verstandes ohne Leitung eines anderen zu bedienen. 
    Selbstverschuldet ist diese Unmündigkeit, wenn die Ursache derselben nicht am Mangel des Verstandes, sondern der Entschließung und des Mutes liegt, sich seiner ohne Leitung eines anderen zu bedienen. 
    ‚Sapere aude! Habe Mut, dich deines eigenen Verstandes zu bedienen!‘ ist also der Wahlspruch der Aufklärung"
</p>

<p>
    As you can see, he tried to write as complex as possible with the end goal of confusing as many people as possible.
    It is also known as the "Kant-effect", which describes smart people feeling smarter, and dumb people feeling dumber after reading this.
    Of course it is just gibberish and Kant was just flexing on the haters.

<h3 id="TargetSchopenhauer"> Schopenhauer </h3>

<img src="img/schopenhauer_artur.jpg" class="philosopherpic"/>

<p>
    This man is not the human version of grumpy cat, but rather<strong>Arthur Schopenhauer</strong>
</p>

<p> 
    Arthur Schopenhauers philosophy is best described by his own facial expression. 
    He mastered the art of hating everything, which led to the accumulation of something like a "thunderstorm" around his head. 
    This "cloud of anger" is often falsely claimed to be his hair. 
    Whereas every other philosopher agreed, that one has to accept the opinion that is supported by arguments the best, Schopenhauer said, Quote: "Fuck y'all wimps",
    and continued by arguing, that only winning the argument is truly important. 
    This of course led to every other philosopher calling him a Quote: "twat", 
    but he made a lot of friends with the common peasant, as these people really only use philosophy for their own good.

    To sum up, Schopenhauer is a terrible philosopher, but a brilliant salesman. And for that he receives: (drumroll)

<h3 id="TargetSokrates"> Sokrates</h3>
<img src="img/Sokrates.jpg" class="philosopherpic"/> 

<p>
    Despite being a statue,<strong>Sokrates</strong>was a brilliant mind.
</p>

<p>
    Sokrates knew that he knew nothing which is the perfect requirement to becoming a philosopher. 
    In general, it is said that sokrates brought philosophy from heaven to the streets, as he (looking like a homeless guy)
    went to regular people minding their business and asked them highly philosophical questions such as:
    <lu>
            <li>What is equality?</li>
            <li>Why are you running away?</li>
            <li>Dude chill im not trying to rape you.</li>
    </lu>   
</p>

<p>
    He realized that it is impossible to come to perfect definitions for most things, and that people just assumed that they know what they're talking about.
    He was frustrated with society's lack of wonder and capacity for thinking, that he turned to the only demographic group, that he thought was "unpolluted"
    This group of people were teenagers and young people of all kinds. With them, Sokrates resonated. 
    Ironically he was soon later sentenced to death for "corrupting young people's minds". 
    After long debates with the judges, Sokrates finally gave in and drank the poison on the sunny morning of 12th December 2006.
    In modern times, because of Sokrates' commitment to maieutics, he is often compared to "Ariana Grande", which is a similarly inspiring thinker.

<h3 id="TargetDescartes">Descartes</h3>
<img src="img/Descartes.jpg" class="philosopherpic"/>

<p>
    The man of discardment:<strong>Déscartes</strong>
</p>
    

<p>
    As Déscartes was in the risk group during the Coronavirus-crisis, he decided to self-isolate and think about life.
    Pretty usual so far. But he went ahead and decided to question existence and everything that comes with it entirely.
    He asked himself the question: Bruh, how do we even know...... Yeah, well how do even KNOW?
    A good question that slowly lead him toward an existencial crisis. He easily fended the disaster off with the legendary
    "ego cogito ergo sum" statement, which basically proved his existence. Later on, critics argued that by saying: 
    "ego incognito ergo sum" you're basically non existent again and all the effort was for nothing. 
    But this is not all Déscartes has done. Later on he became a beekeeper and used the newfound knowledge to support his argument, with a piece of wax.
    It sounds stupid, i know, but it also is indeed stupid.
</p>

<p id="RatingDescartes">
    Despite critics arguing about his philosophy, one can safely claim that Déscartes truly innovated in the beekeeping-industry
    and thus receives a solid: (drumroll) <br>
