<h1>Welcome to PhilosophersReviewed</h1>
<p>
    On this page we evaluate various philosophers and their stances on various philosophys
</p>

<h2>How are Philosophers critiqued and reviewed?</h2>
<p>
    We ask ourself multiple questions in the process of rating a philosopher. What are his <strong>worldviews</strong> and how are his <strong>argumentations</strong> formed?
</p>

<h2>Kant</h2>
<img src="Kant.jpeg" alt="This is the famous philosopher Immanuel Kant"/>

<p> 
    This handsome man is called <strong>Immanuel Kant</strong>
</p>

<p>
    Kant tried to completely rethink the way we look at our environment and our role in it.
    His large ideas need a lot of space, hence the enormous forehead. 
    Kant in general is considered a genius, but this is solemnly due to noone understanding him.
    A good example would be his theory about <strong>enlightenment</strong>.

    Kant receives the final rating of: (drumroll)
    <strong>3/10 guillotined heads</strong>
</p>

<h2>Schopenhauer</h2>

<p>
    This man is not the human version of grumpy cat, but rather <strong> Arthur Schopenhauer</strong>
</p>

<p> 
    Arthur Schopenhauers philosophy is best described by his own facial expression. 
    He mastered the art of hating everything, which led to his head accumulating something like a "thunderstorm" around his head. 
    This "cloud of anger" is often falsely claimed to be his hair. 
    Whereas every other philosopher agreed, that one has to accept the opinion that is supported by arguments the best, Schopenhauer said, Quote: "Fuck y'all wimps", and foll
